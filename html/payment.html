    <h1> a payment system </h1>
  </main>
    <p2>Designed for the Internet, globaldce offer alternatives to payment systems based on legal tender currencies. It make it possible to increase the accessibility of e-commerce in developing countries.<br><br></p2>
    <p2>All transactions are public, with owners and recipients of these transactions identified by addresses.<br><br></p2>
    <p2>globaldce coins cannot easily be counterfeited or spoofed. The encryption protocol is also designed to be highly resilient against most known computer threats, including distributed denial of service attacks.<br><br></p2>
    <p2>Transfer fees sometimes zero and lower than those of payment establishments or those of fund transfer companies.<br><br></p2>
    <p2>Worldwide transfers possible regardless of country.<br><br></p2>
    <p2>Absence of intermediary (payment establishment, payment service intermediary, bank, custodian): the amount credited is taken directly to the reception address.<br><br></p2>
    <p2>Any individual or company can transfer cryptocurrency.<br><br></p2>
    <p2>Storing the cryptocurrency remotely on a server or for downloading to a medium (USB key, for example).<br><br></p2>
    <p2>The total amount of globaldce coins that can be created is capped, making the globaldce cryptocurrency deflationary in essence (the amount of money can theoretically only decrease over time).<br><br></p2>
